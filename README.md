# Serveoshell
This is a lightweight reverse shell manager written in Go that leverages Serveo.net to expose a local port to the internet and receive reverse shells from remote systems. Serveo acts as an SSH-based tunneling service, making it easy to get incoming connections without setting up port forwarding or cloud servers.
